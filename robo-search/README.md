# Robo-search!
Robo-search was a really tiny website that I made for my friend Robert who wanted to use it for creating a lyric video for one of his songs. You can find the lyric video [here](https://youtu.be/v5HN0ecilVg)!
This was created with pure html, css and js in maybe like 35 minutes haha

The searching part doesn't really work, he just wanted to type stuff into the text box and when Enter is press, it'll just appear right below the text box.
